%description
Ensemble of messages to communicate/request kinematics-related issues.
NOTE/DISCLAIMER: A lot of these messages have been salvaged from now deprecated
packages arm_navigation_msgs and kinematics_msgs. We acknowledge original
authorship of these messages to all involved people (I, Georg, do not know them
by name).
